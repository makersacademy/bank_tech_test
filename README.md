This is a simple bank account app that allows you to deposit and withdraw money and also print statements to display all deposits, withdrawls and your current balance.

The app is written in the Ruby programming language and runs on the Ruby GUI Shoes (http://shoesrb.com/).


## Getting Started
* Clone this repository to your computer
* Using your command line navigate to the directory where you have saved the clone and run 'bundle'
* Download the latest version of the Ruby Shoes GUI from http://shoesrb.com/
* Open the Shoes app and select 'Open an App' and select app.rb from the cloned directory.

## Using the app
The app is quite self explanatory, enter deposits or withdrawls you wish to make and confirm by clicking the relevant button to submit them.

You can print out a statement of all transactions/deposits/withdrawls at anytime by clicking the relevant button which will produce the statement in a new window.
