##Introduction

The following repository contains code for the purpose of passing the Makers Academy Week_#12 'bank_tech_test-1'.

The parent folder to this 'README.md' file also contains a 'README.md' file which lays out the requirements of this tech test. Based on this, a set of user stories have been extracted and these will form the basis of how this challenge is completed.

I have chosen to use Ruby to complete the test as it is the language I am personally most comfortable in, as well as the language I feel I can get a project up and running in the fastest.

I have also chosen to take a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach to this test, as for me, it really assists in driving the direction of the code I write.
